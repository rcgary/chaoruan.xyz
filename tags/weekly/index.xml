<p>It comes as no surprise that since the launch of the New Bing, Google hasn&rsquo;t developed any significant products to compete with Microsoft. I&rsquo;ve primarily been using DuckDuckGo for the past two years, but I still switch to Google if I feel like I&rsquo;m missing something. I believe this habit will become less frequent now that we have ChatGPT.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, those who know how to utilize the tools effectively will be the ones who remain, while those who fear the tools will be left behind and forgotten.</p>

<p>Just last week, <a href="https://chaoruan.xyz/posts/weekly-summary-2023-04-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">I was questioning Meta&rsquo;s future</a>, and now a new round of layoffs has begun. I can&rsquo;t imagine if I were at Meta right now â€“ I&rsquo;d probably be one of the engineers facing a layoff for sure.</p>
<h3 id="steam-unrecord"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2381520/Unrecord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Steam - Unrecord</a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see that this game is almost ready for release. I can&rsquo;t wait to play it. It&rsquo;s not surprising that Unreal Engine 5 can already support such a realistic experience, but I&rsquo;m curious about what the system requirements will be like.</p>

<p>The text-to-auto-generative models are truly impressive, as they can generate laughs, sighs, throat clearing, and gasps, making it incredibly realistic in English. I tried it in Chinese too, and although it&rsquo;s not ideal, I expect these models will improve soon. I&rsquo;d love to have this kind of audio model running in my home lab one day.</p>

<p>I watched this movie today. Initially, I didn&rsquo;t plan on watching it, but a few gamers&rsquo; reviews changed my mind, so I decided to check it out. I&rsquo;ll write a dedicated post about it later. tldr. I love it</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h2>
<p>The palm trees in our yard have been growing incredibly fast in recent months, and it feels like they&rsquo;ve grown three meters taller in just one summer. Due to their location and the strong winds in Melbourne, they sway dangerously and seem ready to fall into our neighbor&rsquo;s yard at any moment. After discussing with my wife, we decided to hire professionals to cut down these trees. Although I don&rsquo;t want to cut down trees, we had to do it for safety reasons.

            </div><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start documenting my weekly life by providing a brief summary of what I&rsquo;ve read, watched, and done in the past week.</p>

<p>This Blog post takes me back to when I landed my first job in the US in March 2020. Shortly after selling my house and moving all my possessions to the US, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. My wife and I found ourselves using Airbnb, and the mounting uncertainty left me concerned about the possibility of being laid off. Fun time!</p>

<p>Perhaps one day, I&rsquo;ll go through the list here, find a class that interests me, and begin learning once more.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re all aware that Meta isn&rsquo;t as great as it once was. With the unrealistic version of the metaverse and the ongoing layoffs, it seems that nobody knows what the future holds for Meta, at least for the time being.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that if I use this for programming, I&rsquo;ll lose weight fairly quickly.</p>

<p>I always enjoy hearing about people&rsquo;s Emacs experiences, but this one is truly next level. I appreciate all the charts illustrating the time and data the author spent in different areas. As usual, if you want to spark a lot of replies on Hacker News, just mention Vim or Emacs!</p>

<p>Vector databases are quite popular nowadays, but whether you need one depends on your specific use case. It seems that having a vector database is essential if you plan to work with machine learning or large language models.</p>

<p>This prompts me to reflect on my true aspirations as an engineer. I&rsquo;m interested in the hybrid roles mentioned later in the post, perhaps as a tech lead. But I wonder how that would work in a remote position. I&rsquo;m not yet convinced that managing a team of engineers remotely is entirely feasible.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a one-minute read, but I genuinely appreciate the points the author makes here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donâ€™t announce anything. Donâ€™t choose a name. Donâ€™t make a website or an app. Donâ€™t build a system. You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.
Then you get your first paying customer. Provide a one-on-one personal service. Then you get another paying customer. Prove a real demand.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m eager to start generating passive income, and a YouTube video introduced me to the concept of stock video creation. Although I&rsquo;ve never tried it before, it might be a fun endeavor to explore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stock footage, also known as stock video or B-roll, is pre-filmed footage that can be purchased and used in a variety of projects and films. Stock footage can be licensed and saves filmmakers the time and money of shooting original material.</p>
