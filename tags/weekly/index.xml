<p>Google&rsquo;s Passkeys seem interesting. I&rsquo;m curious about when we&rsquo;ll see broader use cases that aren&rsquo;t limited to just a few companies. I also wonder about support for people with blurred fingerprints. I tried following the setup process from the provided link, but to be honest, the experience could be better.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a week since Andrew Ng&rsquo;s guide came out. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to take a look at it, but I keep making all sorts of excuses not to. I&rsquo;ll set a goal for myself, hoping to thoroughly review it next week.</p>

<p>Last week, I was complaining about the lackluster fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But this Sunday, I saw a long-awaited great Marvel movie. The director&rsquo;s aesthetic taste is as impressive as ever, with excellent visuals and sound. If only every film in the fourth phase were of this caliber! This should be the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but there&rsquo;s no need for regrets. We must say goodbye to the past, move forward, and never look back.</p>

<p>The Marvel film is visually stunning but disappointing. The fourth phase of the Marvel universe doesn&rsquo;t offer much to see. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t waste money going to the cinema. However, how does <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0748620/?ref_=tt_cl_i_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Paul Rudd</a> manage to not age at all?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that I&rsquo;ve only just discovered Yabai, such a handy window management tool. I can&rsquo;t get enough of it since I started using it! It has resolved many of the pain points I faced previously. Moreover, it gives me the opportunity to make full use of Mac&rsquo;s multiple desktops. I spent an evening setting it up on both my work and personal MacBook Pros. After using it for a week, I know I can&rsquo;t live without it.</p>

<p>My dotfiles management has always been a bit haphazard, but Yabai and SKHD made me realize that syncing dotfiles across multiple systems is becoming increasingly necessary. Previously, I used my own script for syncing, but this time I adopted Stow and moved my Emacs config over as well. I basically followed the setup provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">System Crafters</a> on YouTube.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to buy the latest Sonos speaker, released just last month, at a 30% discount.

I used this setup to watch  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)</a> and the experience was quite impressive.

<p>It comes as no surprise that since the launch of the New Bing, Google hasn&rsquo;t developed any significant products to compete with Microsoft. I&rsquo;ve primarily been using DuckDuckGo for the past two years, but I still switch to Google if I feel like I&rsquo;m missing something. I believe this habit will become less frequent now that we have ChatGPT.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s amazing to see that this game is almost ready for release. I can&rsquo;t wait to play it. It&rsquo;s not surprising that Unreal Engine 5 can already support such a realistic experience, but I&rsquo;m curious about what the system requirements will be like.</p>

<p>The text-to-auto-generative models are truly impressive, as they can generate laughs, sighs, throat clearing, and gasps, making it incredibly realistic in English. I tried it in Chinese too, and although it&rsquo;s not ideal, I expect these models will improve soon. I&rsquo;d love to have this kind of audio model running in my home lab one day.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I Did</h2>
<p>The palm trees in our yard have been growing incredibly fast in recent months, and it feels like they&rsquo;ve grown three meters taller in just one summer. Due to their location and the strong winds in Melbourne, they sway dangerously and seem ready to fall into our neighbor&rsquo;s yard at any moment. After discussing with my wife, we decided to hire professionals to cut down these trees. Although I don&rsquo;t want to cut down trees, we had to do it for safety reasons.

<p>This Blog post takes me back to when I landed my first job in the US in March 2020. Shortly after selling my house and moving all my possessions to the US, the COVID-19 pandemic struck. My wife and I found ourselves using Airbnb, and the mounting uncertainty left me concerned about the possibility of being laid off. Fun time!</p>
