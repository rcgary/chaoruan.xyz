<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that I&rsquo;ve only just discovered Yabai, such a handy window management tool. I can&rsquo;t get enough of it since I started using it! It has resolved many of the pain points I faced previously. Moreover, it gives me the opportunity to make full use of Mac&rsquo;s multiple desktops. I spent an evening setting it up on both my work and personal MacBook Pros. After using it for a week, I know I can&rsquo;t live without it.</p>

<p>My dotfiles management has always been a bit haphazard, but Yabai and SKHD made me realize that syncing dotfiles across multiple systems is becoming increasingly necessary. Previously, I used my own script for syncing, but this time I adopted Stow and moved my Emacs config over as well. I basically followed the setup provided by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">System Crafters</a> on YouTube.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate to buy the latest Sonos speaker, released just last month, at a 30% discount.

I used this setup to watch  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10954600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)</a> and the experience was quite impressive.

<p>The palm trees in our yard have been growing incredibly fast in recent months, and it feels like they&rsquo;ve grown three meters taller in just one summer. Due to their location and the strong winds in Melbourne, they sway dangerously and seem ready to fall into our neighbor&rsquo;s yard at any moment. After discussing with my wife, we decided to hire professionals to cut down these trees. Although I don&rsquo;t want to cut down trees, we had to do it for safety reasons.

inside the Spacemacs workflow, after a look through the documentation, of
course we can do it</p>
<p>First, we need to let Spacemacs load zsh when it setup <code>shell</code>, and I found
you can do a pop-up buffer style with 30% of the current height from the
bottom.</p>
<p>So in <code>.spacemacs</code> we can set this in <code>dotspacemacs-configure-layers</code>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This change is the basic setup, <strong>but since I enabled <code>vi</code> key bindings in my
zsh, it starts conflicts with Spacemacs <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">evil-mode</a>.</strong> after a play around with different
settings, I found the best option for me is to disable the evil-mode inside
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ansi-term</a>.</p>
<p>Add following code in <code>dotspacemacs/user-config</code>:</p>
