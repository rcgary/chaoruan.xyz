Google's Passkeys seem interesting. I'm curious about when we'll see broader use cases that aren't limited to just a few companies. I also wonder about support for people with blurred fingerprints. I tried following the setup process from the provided link, but to be honest, the experience could be better.

It's unlikely that a CEO would be deeply concerned about every employee. As employees, our main focus should be doing our jobs, getting paid, and moving forward.

Last week, I was complaining about the lackluster fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But this Sunday, I saw a long-awaited great Marvel movie. The director's aesthetic taste is as impressive as ever, with excellent visuals and sound. If only every film in the fourth phase were of this caliber! This should be the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but there's no need for regrets. We must say goodbye to the past, move forward, and never look back.

I'm surprised that I've only just discovered Yabai, such a handy window management tool. I can't get enough of it since I started using it! It has resolved many of the pain points I faced previously. Moreover, it gives me the opportunity to make full use of Mac's multiple desktops. I spent an evening setting it up on both my work and personal MacBook Pros. After using it for a week, I know I can't live without it.
**** [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][Stow]]
My dotfiles management has always been a bit haphazard, but Yabai and SKHD made me realize that syncing dotfiles across multiple systems is becoming increasingly necessary. Previously, I used my own script for syncing, but this time I adopted Stow and moved my Emacs config over as well. I basically followed the setup provided by [[https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters][System Crafters]] on YouTube.

It comes as no surprise that since the launch of the New Bing, Google hasn't developed any significant products to compete with Microsoft. I've primarily been using DuckDuckGo for the past two years, but I still switch to Google if I feel like I'm missing something. I believe this habit will become less frequent now that we have ChatGPT.

The text-to-auto-generative models are truly impressive, as they can generate laughs, sighs, throat clearing, and gasps, making it incredibly realistic in English. I tried it in Chinese too, and although it's not ideal, I expect these models will improve soon. I'd love to have this kind of audio model running in my home lab one day.

*** What I Did
The palm trees in our yard have been growing incredibly fast in recent months, and it feels like they've grown three meters taller in just one summer. Due to their location and the strong winds in Melbourne, they sway dangerously and seem ready to fall into our neighbor's yard at any moment. After discussing with my wife, we decided to hire professionals to cut down these trees. Although I don't want to cut down trees, we had to do it for safety reasons.

   I start reading [[https://onevcat.com/][onevcat]] new book [[https://objccn.io/products/swift-ui][/SwiftUI and Combine Programming/]] (a great
   book to learning SwiftUI if you can read Chinese). I decided to put all the
   interest parts and notes in here.
   #+hugo: more
*** First things First
    We always need to ~import~ the dependency first
    #+begin_src swift
      import SwiftUI
      import Combine
    #+end_src
*** Layout all the views in the body
    #+begin_src swift
      var body: some View {
          /// Layout your view here
      }
    #+end_src
    ~some View~ is a new concept introduced in Swift 5.1, which called [[https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/OpaqueTypes.html][Opaque
    Types]]. Maybe someday I will write a more detail post for opaque types, in
    short, opaque types kind like ~protocol~ but more powerful.
*** Enable Canvas in Xcode
    You can preview the UI layouts using /Canvas/, which is convincing by
    ~PreviewProvider~. As long as your swift file have a ~struct~ confirm it, you
    will able to work with SwiftUI and preview changes using /Canvas/ support (Xcode 11+ and OS X
    10.15 + Only)
    #+begin_src swift
      struct MyView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
          static var previews: some View {
              MyView()
          }
      }
    #+end_src
**** Canvas is not fast
     *At least not fast as I wish*, we still need to build the whole project
     first, then it starts working as we hope. But sometimes I found I may
     easier break the UI, then Xcode start not happy anymore, showing this on canvas
     #+DOWNLOADED: Xcode not happy
     [[file:images/Blog_ideas/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-07%20at%2010.11.58%20pm_2019-11-07_22-15-44.png]]

     In this case, we have to *resume* the canvas which *rebuilds* the project again 😢
**** Preview with multiple devices
     Canvas support preview with all devices, so we can work on different size
     of screens:
     #+begin_src swift
       struct ContentView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
           static var previews: some View {
               Group {
                   ContentView()
                   ContentView().previewDevice("iPhone SE")
                   ContentView().previewDevice("iPad Air 2")
               }
           }
       }
     #+end_src

     After some loading 😫, we should see something like this:
     #+DOWNLOADED: preview mutiple devices
     [[file:images/Blog_ideas/Screen%20Shot%202019-11-07%20at%2010.26.51%20pm_2019-11-07_22-28-54.png]]

   :EXPORT_DATE: [2019-10-26 Sat 10:58]

   When I start using [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]], I was hoping there is a way to using my own configured [[https://ohmyz.sh/][zsh]]
   inside the Spacemacs workflow, after a look through the documentation, of
   course we can do it
   #+hugo: more
   First, we need to let Spacemacs load zsh when it setup ~shell~, and I found
   you can do a pop-up buffer style with 30% of the current height from the
   bottom.

   So in ~.spacemacs~ we can set this in ~dotspacemacs-configure-layers~:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (shell :variables
            shell-default-term-shell "/bin/zsh" ;; find your zsh path using `$ whereis zsh`
            shell-default-height 30
            shell-default-position 'bottom)
   #+end_src
   This change is the basic setup, *but since I enabled ~vi~ key bindings in my
   zsh, it starts conflicts with Spacemacs [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil-mode]].* after a play around with different
   settings, I found the best option for me is to disable the evil-mode inside
   [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm][ansi-term]].

   Add following code in ~dotspacemacs/user-config~:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (evil-set-initial-state 'term-mode 'emacs)
   #+end_src
   This change allows us navigation in ansi-term, but we can not editing
   anything in the input line. We need to do *one more change*:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (evil-set-initial-state 'term-mode 'emacs) ;; turn off evil-mode for ansi-term
     (setq term-char-mode-point-at-process-mark nil) ;; allow editing in normal mode
   #+end_src
   After ~SPC f e R~, we can now using zsh inside Spacemacs

   #+end_src

   *Everything works fine until I restart emacs*:

   ~ox-hugo~ been marked as *an orphan package* and got removed first then
   reinstalled back immediately.

   By searching and digging around the Spacemacs documentation, I found the
   Spacemacs ~org layer~ already has [[http://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html#hugo-support][org-hugo support by default]] (~development~
   branch only). So we *don't need to follow* the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] usage guide.
   we can do this in ~.spacemacs~
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq-default

      '((org :variables
