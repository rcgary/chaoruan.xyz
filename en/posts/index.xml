<p>Google&rsquo;s Passkeys seem interesting. I&rsquo;m curious about when we&rsquo;ll see broader use cases that aren&rsquo;t limited to just a few companies.

<p>Last week, I was complaining about the lackluster fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But this Sunday, I saw a long-awaited great Marvel movie. The director&rsquo;s aesthetic taste is as impressive as ever, with excellent visuals and sound. If only every film in the fourth phase were of this caliber! This should be the last Guardians of the Galaxy movie, but there&rsquo;s no need for regrets. We must say goodbye to the past, move forward, and never look back.</p>

<p>The Marvel film is visually stunning but disappointing. The fourth phase of the Marvel universe doesn&rsquo;t offer much to see. Thankfully, I didn&rsquo;t waste money going to the cinema.

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised that I&rsquo;ve only just discovered Yabai, such a handy window management tool. I can&rsquo;t get enough of it since I started using it! It has resolved many of the pain points I faced previously. Moreover, it gives me the opportunity to make full use of Mac&rsquo;s multiple desktops. I spent an evening setting it up on both my work and personal MacBook Pros. After using it for a week, I know I can&rsquo;t live without it.</p>

<p>My dotfiles management has always been a bit haphazard, but Yabai and SKHD made me realize that syncing dotfiles across multiple systems is becoming increasingly necessary. Previously, I used my own script for syncing, but this time I adopted Stow and moved my Emacs config over as well.

<p>The palm trees in our yard have been growing incredibly fast in recent months, and it feels like they&rsquo;ve grown three meters taller in just one summer. Due to their location and the strong winds in Melbourne, they sway dangerously and seem ready to fall into our neighbor&rsquo;s yard at any moment. After discussing with my wife, we decided to hire professionals to cut down these trees. Although I don&rsquo;t want to cut down trees, we had to do it for safety reasons.

inside the Spacemacs workflow, after a look through the documentation, of
course we can do it</p>
<p>First, we need to let Spacemacs load zsh when it setup <code>shell</code>, and I found
you can do a pop-up buffer style with 30% of the current height from the
bottom.</p>
<p>So in <code>.spacemacs</code> we can set this in <code>dotspacemacs-configure-layers</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">shell</span> <span class="nb">:variables</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       <span class="nv">shell-default-term-shell</span> <span class="s">&#34;/bin/zsh&#34;</span> <span class="c1">;; find your zsh path using `$ whereis zsh`</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       <span class="nv">shell-default-height</span> <span class="mi">30</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">       <span class="nv">shell-default-position</span> <span class="ss">&#39;bottom</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This change is the basic setup, <strong>but since I enabled <code>vi</code> key bindings in my
zsh, it starts conflicts with Spacemacs <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">evil-mode</a>.</strong> after a play around with different
settings, I found the best option for me is to disable the evil-mode inside
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AnsiTerm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ansi-term</a>.</p>
<p>Add following code in <code>dotspacemacs/user-config</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">evil-set-initial-state</span> <span class="ss">&#39;term-mode</span> <span class="ss">&#39;emacs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This change allows us navigation in ansi-term, but we can not editing
anything in the input line. We need to do <strong>one more change</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-emacs-lisp" data-lang="emacs-lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">evil-set-initial-state</span> <span class="ss">&#39;term-mode</span> <span class="ss">&#39;emacs</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; turn off evil-mode for ansi-term</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After <code>SPC f e R</code>, we can now using zsh inside Spacemacs</p>

<p><code>ox-hugo</code> been marked as <strong>an orphan package</strong> and got removed first then
reinstalled back immediately.</p>
<p>By searching and digging around the Spacemacs documentation, I found the

branch only). So we <strong>don&rsquo;t need to follow</strong> the <a href="https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">ox-hugo</a> usage guide.
we can do this in <code>.spacemacs</code></p>
